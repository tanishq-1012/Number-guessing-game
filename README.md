## Objective

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a fun and simple Python-based console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The player has 7 attempts to guess the correct number.

## How the Game Works

To understand how the number guessing game functions, let’s walk through two practical scenarios. These examples demonstrate how narrowing down the range intelligently—similar to a binary search—can help guess the number efficiently.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. The game begins by asking the user to input a lower bound and an upper bound.

2. The computer will randomly choose a number within that range.

3. You get 7 chances to guess the number correctly.

4. After each guess, you'll receive a hint:

  “Too high! Try a lower number.” or

  “Too low! Try a higher number.”

5.If you guess it correctly within 7 tries, you win!

6. If not, the correct number is revealed and the game ends.
